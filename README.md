# react-app-architecture

## What's this?
:house: It's a reference architecture to build a Server Side Rendering / Universal web app with React. 

## What could it be used for?
Somethimes setting everything up to share components between server and client and get the most of the Server Side Rendering can be tricky. This architecture suggests a simple way to do it.

### Tech Stack
```
- React 16
- Babel
- NodeJS + Express
- Webpack
- SASS
- ESLint
```

### Usage
This app is empty and only has a trivial component as an example. The main idea is to give a reference about how to structure and build a proper architecture for an isomorphic App.  
:warning:This architecture does not apply to an SPA application, since it does not implement React Router. All the routing is made via express.

## Build the application
```
npm run build
```

## Run the server
```
npm run start
```

## To browse the app, just navigate to:
```
localhost:8081
```
