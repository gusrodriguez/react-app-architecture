# react-app-architecture

## Reference architecture to build an universal web app by using the following tools:
  This app is't just an empty app with an example component, to give a reference about how to structure and build a proper architecture for a Universal App.
  Folder structure is just a suggestion. The app uses webpack to serve only one .js resource and one .css resource. It also uses server side rendering, all in order to get a good perfomance.
  This app shoul not be used for an SPA application, since it does not implement React Router. All the routing is made via express.

* React 16
* Babel
* NodeJS + Express
* Webpack
* SASS
* ESLint

## Build the application
    npm run build
    
## Run the server
    npm run start
